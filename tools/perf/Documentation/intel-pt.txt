Intel Processor Trace
=====================

perf record
===========

new event
---------

The Intel PT kernel driver creates a new PMU for Intel PT.  PMU events are
selected by providing the PMU name followed by the "config" separated by slashes.
An enhancement has been made to allow default "config" e.g. the option

	-e intel_pt//

will use a default config value.  Currently that is the same as

	-e intel_pt/tsc,noretcomp=0/

which is the same as

	-e intel_pt/tsc=1,noretcomp=0/

The config terms are listed in /sys/devices/intel_pt/format.  They are bit
fields within the config member of the struct perf_event_attr which is
passed to the kernel by the perf_event_open system call.  They correspond to bit
fields in the IA32_RTIT_CTL MSR.  Here is a list of them and their definitions:

	$ for f in `ls /sys/devices/intel_pt/format`;do
	> echo $f
	> cat /sys/devices/intel_pt/format/$f
	> done
	noretcomp
	config:11
	tsc
	config:10

Note that the default config must be overridden for each term i.e.

	-e intel_pt/noretcomp=0/

is the same as:

	-e intel_pt/tsc=1,noretcomp=0/

So, to disable TSC packets use:

	-e intel_pt/tsc=0/

It is also possible to specify the config value explicitly:

	-e intel_pt/config=0x400/

Note that, as with all events, the event is suffixed with event modifiers:

	u	userspace
	k	kernel
	h	hypervisor
	G	guest
	H	host
	p	precise ip

'h', 'G' and 'H' are for virtualization which is not supported by Intel PT.
'p' is also not relevant to Intel PT.  So only options 'u' and 'k' are
meaningful for Intel PT.

perf_event_attr is displayed if the -vv option is used e.g.

	------------------------------------------------------------
	perf_event_attr:
	type                6

	sys_perf_event_open: pid 7198  cpu 3  group_fd -1  flags 0x8
	------------------------------------------------------------


AUX sampling option
-------------------

To select Intel PT "sampling" the AUX sampling option is used:

	-Aintel_pt

Optionally it can be followed by the sample size in bytes e.g.

	-A4096intel_pt

It is important to select a sample size that is big enough to contain at least
one PSB packet.  If not a warning will be displayed:

	Intel PT sample size (%zu) may be too small for PSB period (%zu)

The calculation used for that is: if sample_size <= psb_period + 256 display the
warning.

The default sample size is currently 4KiB

The sample size is passed in aux_sample_size in struct perf_event_attr.  The
sample size is limited by the maximum event size which is 64KiB.  It is
difficult to know how big the event might be without the trace sample attached,
but the tool validates that the sample size is not greater than 60KiB.

The sample size is displayed if the option -vv is used e.g.

	Intel PT sample size: %zu

Optionally the "config" can be specified in exactly the same fashion as the
intel_pt event e.g.

	-Aintel_pt/tsc=0,noretcomp=0/

or

	-A1024intel_pt/tsc=0,noretcomp=0/


new snapshot option
-------------------

To select snapshot mode a new option has been added:

	-S

Optionally it can be followed by the snapshot size e.g.

	-S0x100000

The default snapshot size is the itrace mmap size.  If neither itrace mmap size
nor snapshot size is specified, then the default is 4MiB for privileged users
(or if /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 0), 128KiB for unprivileged users.
If an unprivileged user does not specify mmap pages, the mmap pages will be
reduced as described in the 'new itrace mmap size option' section below.

The snapshot size is displayed if the option -vv is used e.g.

	Intel PT snapshot size: %zu


new itrace mmap size option
---------------------------

Intel PT buffer size is specified by an addition to the -m option e.g.

	-m,16

selects a buffer size of 16 pages i.e. 64KiB.

Note that the existing functionality of -m is unchanged.  The itrace mmap size
is specified by the optional addition of a comma and the value.

The default itrace mmap size for Intel PT is 4MiB/page_size for privileged users
(or if /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 0), 128KiB for unprivileged users.
If an unprivileged user does not specify mmap pages, the mmap pages will be
reduced from the default 512KiB/page_size to 256KiB/page_size, otherwise the
user is likely to get an error as they exceed their mlock limit (Max locked
memory as shown in /proc/self/limits).  Note that perf does not count the first
512KiB (actually /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb minus 1 page) per cpu
against the mlock limit so an unprivileged user is allowed 512KiB per cpu plus
their mlock limit (which defaults to 64KiB but is not multiplied by the number
of cpus).

In full-trace mode, powers of two are allowed for buffer size, with a minimum
size of 2 pages.  In snapshot mode, it is the same but the minimum size is
1 page.  In sample mode, the driver manages the buffer size.

The mmap size and itrace mmap size are displayed if the -vv option is used e.g.

	mmap length 528384
	itrace mmap length 4198400


Intel PT modes of operation
---------------------------

Intel PT can be used in 3 modes:
	full-trace mode
	sample mode
	snapshot mode

Full-trace mode traces continuously e.g.

	perf record -e intel_pt//u uname

Sample mode attaches a Intel PT sample to other events e.g.

	perf record -e branch-misses:u -I uname

Snapshot mode captures the available data when a signal is sent e.g.

	perf record -v -e intel_pt//u -S ./loopy 1000000000 &
	[1] 11435
	kill -USR2 11435
	Recording instruction tracing snapshot

Note that the signal sent is SIGUSR2.
Note that "Recording instruction tracing snapshot" is displayed because the -v
option is used.

None of the 3 modes can be used together.


Buffer handling
---------------

There may be buffer limitations (i.e. single ToPa entry) which means that actual
buffer sizes are limited to powers of 2 up to 4MiB (MAX_ORDER).  In order to
provide other sizes, and in particular an arbitrarily large size, multiple
buffers are logically concatenated.  However an interrupt must be used to switch
between buffers.  That has two potential problems:
	a) the interrupt may not be handled in time so that the current buffer
	becomes full and some trace data is lost.
	b) the interrupts may slow the system and affect the performance
	results.

If trace data is lost, the driver sets 'truncated' in the PERF_RECORD_AUX event
which the tools report as an error.

In full-trace mode, the driver waits for data to be copied out before allowing
the (logical) buffer to wrap-around.  If data is not copied out quickly enough,
again 'truncated' is set in the PERF_RECORD_AUX event.  If the driver has to
wait, the intel_pt event gets disabled.  Because it is difficult to know when
that happens, perf tools always re-enable the intel_pt event after copying out
data.


Intel PT and build ids
----------------------

By default "perf record" post-processes the event stream to find all build ids
for executables for all addresses sampled.  Deliberately, Intel PT is not
decoded for that purpose (it would take too long).  Instead the build ids for
all executables encountered (due to mmap, comm or task events) are included
in the perf.data file.

To see buildids included in the perf.data file use the command:

	perf buildid-list

If the perf.data file contains Intel PT data, that is the same as:

	perf buildid-list --with-hits


Snapshot mode and event disabling
---------------------------------

In order to make a snapshot, the intel_pt event is disabled using an IOCTL,
namely PERF_EVENT_IOC_DISABLE.  However doing that can also disable the
collection of side-band information.  In order to prevent that,  a dummy
software event has been introduced that permits tracking events (like mmaps) to
continue to be recorded while intel_pt is disabled.  That is important to ensure
there is complete side-band information to allow the decoding of subsequent
snapshots.

A test has been created for that.  To find the test:

	perf test list
	...
	23: Test using a dummy software event to keep tracking

To run the test:

	perf test 23
	23: Test using a dummy software event to keep tracking     : Ok


perf record modes (nothing new here)
------------------------------------

perf record essentially operates in one of three modes:
	per thread
	per cpu
	workload only

"per thread" mode is selected by -t or by --per-thread (with -p or -u or just a
workload).
"per cpu" is selected by -C or -a.
"workload only" mode is selected by not using the other options but providing a
command to run (i.e. the workload).

In per-thread mode an exact list of threads is traced.  There is no inheritance.
Each thread has its own event buffer.

In per-cpu mode all processes (or processes from the selected cgroup i.e. -G
option, or processes selected with -p or -u) are traced.  Each cpu has its own
buffer. Inheritance is allowed.

In workload-only mode, the workload is traced but with per-cpu buffers.
Inheritance is allowed.  Note that you can now trace a workload in per-thread
mode by using the --per-thread option.


Privileged vs non-privileged users
----------------------------------

Unless /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is set to -1, unprivileged users
have memory limits imposed upon them.  That affects what buffer sizes they can
have as outlined above.

Unless /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid is set to -1, unprivileged users are
not permitted to use tracepoints which means there is insufficient side-band
information to decode Intel PT in per-cpu mode, and potentially workload-only
mode too if the workload creates new processes.

Note also, that to use tracepoints, read-access to debugfs is required.  So if
debugfs is not mounted or the user does not have read-access, it will again not
be possible to decode Intel PT in per-cpu mode.

Note however, Intel PT samples are always decoded because the sample is very
likely to be mainly from the thread that was running when the sample was taken.
Obviously, if the sample includes a context switch from another process the
decoding will fail if tracepoints were not available.


sched_switch tracepoint
-----------------------

The sched_switch tracepoint is used to provide side-band data for Intel PT
decoding.  sched_switch events are automatically added. e.g. the second event
shown below

	$ perf record -vv -e intel_pt//u uname

	perf_event_attr:

Note, the sched_switch event is only added if the user is permitted to use it
and only in per-cpu mode.

Note also, the sched_switch event is only added if TSC packets are requested.
That is because, in the absence of timing information, the sched_switch events
cannot be matched against the Intel PT trace.


perf script
===========

By default, perf script will decode trace data found in the perf.data file.
This can be further controlled by new option -Z.


New instruction trace option
----------------------------

Having no option is the same as

	-Z

which, in turn, is the same as

	-Zibe

The letters are:

	i	synthesize "instructions" events
	b	synthesize "branches" events
	c	synthesize branches events (calls only)
	r	synthesize branches events (returns only)
	e	synthesize tracing error events
	d	create a debug log
	g	synthesize a call chain for instructions events

"Instructions" events look like they were recorded by "perf record -e
instructions".

"Branches" events look like they were recorded by "perf record -e branches". "c"
and "r" can be combined to get calls and returns.

Error events are new.  They show where the decoder lost the trace.  Error events
are quite important.  Users must know if what they are seeing is a complete
picture or not.

The "d" option will cause the creation of a file "intel_pt.log" containing all
decoded packets and instructions.  Note that this option slows down the decoder
and that the resulting file may be very large.

In addition, the period of the "instructions" event can be specified. e.g.

	-Zi10us

sets the period to 10us i.e. one  instruction sample is synthesized for each 10
microseconds of trace.  Alternatives to "us" are "ms" (milliseconds),
"ns" (nanoseconds), "t" (TSC ticks) or "i" (instructions).

"ms", "us" and "ns" are converted to TSC ticks.

The timing information included with Intel PT does not give the time of every
instruction.  Consequently, for the purpose of sampling, the decoder estimates
the time since the last timing packet based on 1 tick per instruction.  The time
on the sample is *not* adjusted and reflects the last known value of TSC.

For Intel PT, the default period is 100us.

Also the call chain size (default 16, max. 1024) for instructions events can be
specified. e.g.

	-Zg32

To disable trace decoding entirely, use the option --no-itrace.


dump option
-----------

perf script has an option (-D) to "dump" the events i.e. display the binary
data.

When -D is used, Intel PT packets are displayed.  The packet decoder does not
pay attention to PSB packets, but just decodes the bytes - so the packets seen
by the actual decoder may not be identical in places where the data is corrupt.
One example of that would be when the buffer-switching interrupt has been too
slow, and the buffer has been filled completely.  In that case, the last packet
in the buffer might be truncated and immediately followed by a PSB as the trace
continues in the next buffer.

To disable the display of Intel PT packets, combine the -D option with
--no-itrace.


perf report
===========

By default, perf report will decode trace data found in the perf.data file.
This can be further controlled by new option -Z exactly the same as perf script,
with the exception that the default is -Zge.


perf inject
===========

perf inject also accepts the -Z option in which case tracing data is removed and
replaced with the synthesized events. e.g.

	perf inject -Z -i perf.data -o perf.data.new
